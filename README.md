# Flora-Classification-Model
The aim of our regression analysis is to find which customers are individual buyers or
wholesalers based on the quantity of items they have purchased. Customers who buy at least 5
units per product will be eligible for a 3.5% discount under the ‘Flora for Business’ marketing
campaign. The logistic regression classifying algorithm accurately predicted that 81% of the
customers are wholesalers. With a recall value of 1.00 we can decipher that the correct positive
predictions relative to the total actual positives were identified correctly as wholesalers. Thus, the
model will allow the newly created customer center to accurately identify the customers to email
and call for the promotion.
